Given the project structure with builder, types, and validator packages, it seems the project is designed to construct and validate queries. My proposed
  enhancement will focus on integrating Cypher capabilities into this existing framework.

  Here's a complete, step-by-step enhancement plan, broken down into phases to manage complexity:


  Overall Goal: Enable the project to understand, construct, and validate Cypher queries based on the provided manual.


  Phase 0: Initial Project Understanding
   1. Analyze Existing Query Building: Examine builder/query.go, builder/expression.go, builder/entity.go, builder/relationship.go to understand the current query
      construction patterns and data structures.
   2. Analyze Existing Validation: Review validator/query.go to see how existing queries are validated.
   3. Review Test Coverage: Look at tests/query_builder_test.go and tests/query_test.go to understand the testing methodology.


  Phase 1: Cypher Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Definition
   1. Define Core AST Nodes: Create new Go structs in a dedicated cypher/ast package (or similar) to represent fundamental Cypher components:
       * NodePattern, RelationshipPattern
       * PropertyMap, Label
       * Expression (for literals, variables, functions, operators)
       * Clause interface, with implementations for MatchClause, WhereClause, ReturnClause, CreateClause, etc.
       * Query struct to hold a sequence of clauses.
   2. Map Cypher Features to AST: Systematically go through docs/manual.md and define AST nodes for each Cypher feature:
       * Reading Clauses: MATCH, OPTIONAL MATCH, WHERE, UNWIND.
       * Writing Clauses: CREATE, DELETE, SET, REMOVE, MERGE.
       * Return/Projection: RETURN, WITH, ORDER BY, LIMIT, SKIP.
       * Expressions: Operators (=, AND, OR, STARTS WITH, =~), functions (string, list, math, node/relationship, datetime), CASE expressions.
       * Advanced: Path patterns (shortestPath, allShortestPaths), subqueries (EXISTS, COUNT), list comprehensions.


  Phase 2: Cypher Parser Implementation
   1. Choose Parsing Strategy:
       * Option A (Recommended for robustness): Utilize a parser generator like ANTLR4 (with Go target) or explore existing Go libraries for Cypher parsing (e.g.,
         github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver might have internal parsing components, or other community projects). This is generally more robust for complex grammars.
       * Option B (Manual): Implement a hand-written recursive descent parser. This offers more control but is more time-consuming and error-prone for a language as
         rich as Cypher.
   2. Implement Parser: Develop the parser to take a Cypher string and produce the Cypher AST defined in Phase 1. Start with basic MATCH and RETURN statements, then
      progressively add more clauses and expressions.
   3. Error Handling: Implement robust error reporting for syntax errors during parsing.


  Phase 3: Cypher Builder Integration
   1. Extend Existing Builder: Modify the builder package to allow construction of Cypher AST nodes. This might involve:
       * Adding new methods like NewCypherMatch(), NewCypherNode(), NewCypherRelationship(), NewCypherProperty().
       * Adapting existing builder concepts (e.g., Expression) to work with Cypher's expression syntax.
   2. AST to Cypher String Generation: Implement a component (e.g., cypher/generator) that can take the constructed Cypher AST and convert it back into a valid
      Cypher query string. This is crucial for debugging and for any use case where the project needs to output Cypher.


  Phase 4: Cypher Validator Enhancement
   1. Integrate AST Validation: Update the validator/query.go (or create a new cypher/validator package) to validate the Cypher AST. This would involve:
       * Syntax Validation: Ensuring the AST adheres to Cypher's structural rules (e.g., WHERE clause must follow MATCH).
       * Semantic Validation (Optional but Recommended): If the project has a schema concept, validate that labels, relationship types, and properties used in the
         query exist and are used correctly.
       * Type Checking: Basic type checking for expressions (e.g., ensuring arithmetic operations are on numbers).


  Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing
   1. Unit Tests: Write extensive unit tests for:
       * Parser: Test parsing of every Cypher clause, expression, and pattern from docs/manual.md, including valid and invalid syntax.
       * Builder: Test the programmatic construction of various Cypher queries using the new builder methods.
       * Generator: Test that the generated Cypher strings from the AST are correct and match expected output.
       * Validator: Test validation rules, ensuring correct queries pass and incorrect ones fail with appropriate errors.
   2. Integration Tests: Create integration tests that combine parsing, building, and generation to ensure the entire pipeline works correctly.


  Phase 6: Management Clauses and Performance (Future Work/Advanced)
   1. Management Clauses: Decide if the project needs to build or parse management clauses (SHOW, CREATE CONSTRAINT/INDEX, CALL). If so, extend the AST, parser, and
      builder accordingly.
   2. Performance Features: If the project aims to optimize queries, consider how to represent and utilize EXPLAIN, PROFILE, and USING INDEX hints within the AST and
      builder.

  Next Steps:


  To begin, I need to understand the existing Go code. I will start by listing the files in the builder and validator directories and then read the content of
  builder/query.go and validator/query.go.
